# Blockchain-Integrated Medical Imaging - Secure Diagnostics using Deep Learning

## Overview

This project leverages the power of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for medical imaging classification, combined with blockchain technology for secure and immutable report storage. The application is designed to classify chest X-ray images and brain MRI scans, providing diagnostic results that are stored on the Ethereum blockchain prototype.
